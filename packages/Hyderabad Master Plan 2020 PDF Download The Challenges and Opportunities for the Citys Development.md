Hyderabad is one of the fastest growing cities in India and has a population of over 10 million people. The city has a rich history and culture, as well as a vibrant economy and infrastructure. To plan for the future development of the city, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) has prepared a Revised Development Plan (Master Plan) for the erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad Area (HMDA Core Area), which covers an area of 625 sq.km.
 
The Revised Development Plan (Master Plan) aims to provide a vision and framework for the spatial growth and development of the city, taking into account the existing land use, population, transportation, environment, heritage, and other aspects. The plan also proposes various policies and regulations for land use, zoning, building heights, setbacks, parking, open spaces, and other aspects. The plan is intended to guide the public and private sector investments and interventions in the city for the next 20 years.
